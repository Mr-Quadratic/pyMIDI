## COP1500 - Python Project Group 1
# "pyMIDI"

# Pygame - Mixer
- Please look into mixer, as it will be the best library we can currently use to play audio correctly in sync with keyboard inputs. Remember that the naming scheme of the audio files are by octave.
- Therefore, A1 is lower pitched than A2, and F3 is higher pitched than B3.
- Example: Ab1 A1 Bb1 B1 C1 Db1 D1 Eb1 E1 F1 Gb1 G1 Ab2 A2 etc...
- There is an octave 0 (starts at A0) and goes up to octave 8 (ends at G8).

# Keyboard Layout
- https://virtualpiano.net/
- Follow this keyboard layout if possible. Note that this is only five octaves, so we'll need to add either a hotkey to shift the octave up or down, or we can limit ourselves to the middle 5.


# Assignments:
- asterSSH: Project management, Soundbanks, MIDI input/output, Assistance, Stretch goals
- Mr-Quadratic: Base audio output, 
- TJsnapdrag: Base keyboard input,

# Stretch Goals:
- GUI
- Different soundbanks
- LABS soft piano bank [this will take like three days so it's an individual goal]
- MIDI input/output
- MIDI recording
- MIDI playing
- Synesthesia visualizer thing because it's cool
